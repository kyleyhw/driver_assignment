# Documentation Index

This page serves as the central hub for all documentation related to the Driver Assignment Optimization project.

## Core Modules

- [**`define_cost.py`**](./define_cost.md): This document outlines the methodology for calculating the cost matrix, which is a crucial input for the optimization model. It details the use of the Haversine formula for computing geographical distances.

- [**`misc_funcs.py`**](./misc_funcs.md): This document provides information on miscellaneous helper functions used throughout the project. This includes the implementation of the Haversine distance formula and a coordinate translation class.

- [**`solve.py`**](./solve.md): This document explains the main optimization script. It describes the integer programming model, the use of Google's CP-SAT solver, and the constraints and objective function that define the assignment problem.

## Main Project README
